# Pico Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects and code examples for the Raspberry Pi Pico using MicroPython.

The Raspberry Pi Pico is a microcontroller board that provides an affordable and versatile platform for embedded projects. It features the RP2040 microcontroller, which is designed by Raspberry Pi and includes a powerful dual-core ARM Cortex-M0+ processor, along with various peripherals.


## Projects

1. [SOS Morse Code](micropython/sos_morse.py)
This script displays the SOS Morse code on an LED connected to GPIO 25 of the Raspberry Pi Pico. The pattern repeats every 3 seconds, making it an ideal beginner project for learning basic GPIO control and timing with MicroPython.
